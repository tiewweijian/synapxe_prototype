# Last Mile Healthcare Delivery System

The key to improving healthcare delivery in an ageing society is to make healthcare as accessible as possible
Singapore has great healthtech systems in place. However, technology may prove to be a hurdle for many elderlies for many reasons.

Some may not have access to smartphone or computers, and may depend on their children to book appointments.
My objective is to bridge the last-mile for the elderlies and the healthcare system in Singapore


## Solution

Build island-wide kiosks hosting my web application, that are self-sustainable, minimal to maintain and allows for end-user to access basic healthcare services. (Such as booking appointments in Polyclinics, teleconsult, or reschedule appointments)
Such kiosks can be placed at key locations within neighbourhoods, such as lift lobbies, markets, bus stops.

One important feature -- The user interface must be minimal and simple to understand and use

Future expansion could also include Medication Lockers, much like our E- commerce delivery stations at key neighbourhood locations. This would enable users to order recurring medications without having to visit the polyclinic.
This would also prepare us for situations like COVID-19, where we minimise the physical interactions between people.


## Tech Stack
Web-application that can be accessed via any browser on the kiosk. Tech Stack includes node.js, React and MongoDB. Deployable on cloud using Docker for future expansion.
